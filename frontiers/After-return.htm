	<p>It’s October, and I’m always on the verge of tears.
	<p>	I went and returned home from Thief River falls Minnesota, where I did root my feet into a sinking river.
<p>	One night, we gathered in a ditch, and we listened to the words of a young person who had been incorrectly accused of something at camp. There was a lot to be said, but in a moment they lifted spirits and brought us together. They told us praying with your hands is the weakest form of prayer, praying with your voice is a step up, but praying with your feet is the strongest prayer there is.
<p> Earlier that night, we had set up a tipi and as we lifted the heavy birch branches and walked them to the structure, we lost balance and then regained it. I let out a giggle in relief, and was quickly corrected: “Focus. Focus on each other, it’s a prayer. It’s a prayer for the water.” We were praying with our feet.
<p>	Days later I sat in a room with 5 others. The air was heavy and I watched them vow to pray with their feet.
<p> I’m trying to come to terms with feelings of guilt (for not doing everything I could), fear, and discouragement knowing that oil has begun to fill the Line.

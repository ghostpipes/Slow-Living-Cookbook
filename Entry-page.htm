<em>Material Praxis for Ritual Healing</em>
	<p> Our <em>Slow Living Cookbook</em> began as a paratext. In October of 2020, in our last semester of university, we responded, we prompted our peers to respond to a call for sick speech in an anonymous essay in Queer.Archive.Work.’s <a href="https://queer.archive.work/publications/reader2/index.html" class="external"> Urgency Reader 2 (2020)</a>, as we adjusted, strangely, to virtual learning during a pandemic. Now post-university, this call for sick speech echoes as a call for remedy.
		<p>The format of a cookbook was introduced through Tiare Ribeaux’s <a href="http://bioplastic-cookbook.schloss-post.com/" class="external"> Bioplastics Cookbook for Ritual Healing from Petrochemical Landscapes</a>, which exists as an open-source ritual in webpage form. Asynchronously written thoughts, tangential comments, and recipes interrupt and weave together. What began as a resource to share with others eventually became a way for us to keep in touch and an armature to propel thoughts forward into praxis.  In this assemblage, these thoughts, recipes, conversations and interruptions, borrowing from Anna Tsing, become performances of livability.
				<p>Referencing <a href="http://www.luckysoap.com/statements/handmadeweb.html" class="external">J.R. Carpenter</a>, who "evokes the term 'handmade web' in order to draw attention to the physical body...to suggest slowness and smallness as a form of resistance”, the document is published as a hand-coded website, to be archived through collected sound and images after its exhibition. It is a conversation, documented, and through it we shared feelings of grief, longing, and healing without over reliance or burden. The experience was slow, a form of processing that had no deadline.

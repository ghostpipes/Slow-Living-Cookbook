			<p2>It's January (2021) and the (North American) climate network is currently very focused on Stop Line 3. (More at <a href="https://maptheblacksnake.com/" class="external">maptheblacksnake.com</a>). Enbridge is facing lawsuits
 to repeal their construction permits so they’ve ramped up production and are going as fast
  as they can to get it done before those lawsuits can be heard in court. Winona LaDuke is out
  there on the frontlines after a 7 year legal battle with Enbridge. My friend and I are trying to find a way to get to northern "Minnesota" but don’t have a
  vehicle.
</p2>
<br>
<br>
<p3> From DAPL, to Coastal GasLink, to Trans Mountain, to Keystone XL, to Line 3 it’s the same thing again and again. I’ve been thinking a lot about how quickly something becomes a frontier, and how many times over something can become one. Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing wrote that “The frontier, like a film, can be played and replayed.” Expansion doesn’t happen in an exclusively Outward, or Westward, or Forward fashion. It’s outward and inward, and backward and forward, over and under, and oscillating without grace in harsh industrial jerks; never allowing the last to be Final</p3><br>
<br>
<p4>Tsing wrote further in her essay <em>Natural Resources and Capitalist Frontiers</em>, “A rhetoric of democracy is possible in official acts of protection of frontier culture [...] Of course this is a particular kind of democracy, in which women and indigenous residents - and more firmly still, nature - are excluded. Then there is the question of racial and ethnic violence, even genocide.” On the frontier is Promise, is Resource, is Goldrush, is violence, <span style="color: #bcb387" class="comment"><img src="comment-5.png" class=number-five width=300px>is illness</span>, is grief, is mendacity.</p4><br>

<br>
<p5>In her essay, Tsing recounts her personal experience with sexual violation by the frontier-men, and paints an all-too-believable image of men together in isolation. Frontieres weren’t made for us. You talked a lot above about propagation; returning to <span class="sticky"> mothers </span>, fermentation, and networks of mycelium. The frontier is where propagation is termed ‘wild’ and ravaged in masculine fever-dream fantasy. The frontier is where bodies of reproductive labour (human and non-human) are collateral damage.</p5><br>
<br>
<p6>Robin Wall Kimmerer’s chapter of Braiding Sweetgrass of this title, <em>Collateral Damage</em>, made a particularly strong impact on me. I’m still grieving for the salamander mothers trying to drag their pregnant bellies across the road to lay their eggs. And here, pavement is frontier: where bodies of reproduction, of propagation, are torn open under speeding rubber tires.</p6><br>
<br>

<p7> I’ve asked myself what my claim is to grief for a species I barely know, and I’m still struggling with an answer. But like those salamander mothers I have the capacity to progate - slowly. Slow living, slow working, slow function is rejected on the frontier. In nine months I could foster a single new life. Nine months is the amount of time Enbrdige plans to spend getting their pipeline in the ground - an occurrence that will drastically affect uncountable lives in the future. I want so badly to <a href="After-return.htm" class="link">get there this summer</a>, to put my body where it is so opposed to so many others who are far wiser than me, to root my feet down deep with the trees, to where they draw their <span class="sticky"> water </span>.  </p7><br><br></div>
<div class ="collin">
<p8> Migitjo is resilient and she has many relations. You see, <a href="file:///Users/evelynaustin/Downloads/Slow%20Living%20Cookbook%20(V5)/Mounds/Weaving-and-Peeling-Healing.htm" class="link">‘my <span class="sticky">grandmother</span>’</a> was born from the dew on a rock, steamy dew that grew hotter and hotter and grandfather sun, Niskam, was very warm. The globe was warming, and the dew on the rock? Just the right temperature to spring life. </p8><br>
<br>
<p9>This is why we protect the <span class="sticky">water</span>. For it is from which we are born. But acidic rain and trace amounts of glyphosate heated by the power of Niskam now release only noxious gases. <span class="evelyn">Some</span> Grandfathers have forgotten their role in maintaining the status of women, girls and two-spirit and as a result we have lost the ability to propagate meaningful change and traumas of the past have continued to be carried generationally.</p9><br>
<br>
<p10>I dreamed that rolling back the frontier will require a restoration of balance to the sacred circle and water will be part of this. We are seeing this now, with matriarch led movements growing on this Turtle Island and around the world. And ever since I found my oldest relation here on this land, a 400 million year old metamorphic Silurian stone with stretch marks, <Span class="comment"><img src="comment-6.png" class="number-six" width=300>I told myself I will slowly find my own role in this all.</span> My grandmother had her life ruined by bad men with worse intentions, frontiersman, and this made her flee the reserve in the 1970’s. My mother then grew up separated from family and culture as a result of the frontier, and she would go on to find her own frontiersman who would reproduce the same narrative as her mother’s. <p10><br>
<br>
<p11> I think about where I stand on this frontier, and I hope I can slowly learn more about my gender, and my role in embodying an identity thousands of years older than I. Healing myself includes listening to my ancestors and <span class="comment"><img src="comment-7.png" class="number-seven" width=300>becoming the ancestor</span> I want to be remembered as. Can I ever escape the violence that I have experienced through the frontier, or will it always be, as Tsing wrote, “played and replayed” in oscillating industrial jerks?</p11> <br>

    <p12> When I was about 10 I happened across, not a salamander, but a frog migration spot as I was walking through the park near my home. At first I didn’t realize what was beginning to cover the gravel path under my feet, but when I looked more carefully at the what was scattered there, I saw hundreds of tiny frogs the size of my fingertips, densely packed on the stretch in front of me, making their way across a dirt path towards the lake on the other side. I called my sister to come find me and see for herself, and we spent some time watching the cohort make their hesitant journey. When we’d had enough and our attention had begun to wander, it took us nearly an hour to get out from between their tiny, tightly packed bodies. We had to tip-toe, gently, and slowly.</p12><br>
    <br>
    <p13>I took a walk in the rain one night recently and as I walked across city pavement I saw worms scattered before me. And I thought of the frogs and the salamanders, and I tiptoed between them, and stopped to grieve in deep breaths for the ones who had been overlooked and stepped on by hurried passers by. I watched as others riggled slowly and carefully across the payment completing their mission. They’re following the water. </p13><br>

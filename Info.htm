      <p> 
      The publication of <i>Slow Living Cookbook</i> was made possible through the support of Xpace Cultural Centre. 
      Xpace Cultural Centre is a not-for-profit artist-run centre dedicated to providing emerging and student artists, designers, 
      curators and writers with opportunities to showcase their work in a professional setting. 
      
      <br> 
      We approach our programming as a form of world-building: providing exhibitions, events, panels and workshops that respond to 
      the direct needs and interests of our communities and membership. Expanding notions of theory and aesthetics, we seek to hold 
      space for thought-provoking and experimental collaborations. 
     
      <br>
      Xpace Cultural Centre is committed to maintaining an anti-oppressive, queer positive environment, prioritizing marginalized, 
      racialized, Black and Indigenous folks. 
      
      <br>
      Xpace is supported by the OCAD Student Union, and our programming is open to students, as well as emerging practitioners of any 
      educational background. Xpace is not affiliated with OCAD University or the OCAD University gallery system.

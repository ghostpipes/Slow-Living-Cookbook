				<h3>The Mound Beneath Me</h3>
      <blockquote>March 2020 </blockquote>
      <br>
      <p>I found an enormous mound underneath myself.</p>
<p>It stays very still, and I can’t see the bottom, but I think I saw Cerberus crawl out of it and collapse with his mouths full of mud. I watched as soothsayers wondered to and fro, at neck-bone reversed: False prophets of fortune, chanting of Futures and Returns on earth. And me, above them and among them, dragging.</p>
<p>It tugs at my veins and for the sake of my forearms I have to look away. But it’s fusing with my bones, with my nails, with my molars. My centre of gravity pulls right towards its mass: straight ties to my navel.</p>
<p>It’s wallpapered on the inside and paved over on the outside. Although I haven’t investigated thoroughly, it seems to be made up of fractured Arcadia and everything that hides in plain sight - all bound together by polyester threading and petroleum adhesive. </p>
<p>Maybe I can reshape it;
<br>or power wash it;
<br>or innovate it;
<br>maybe I can crowdsource its residents.</p>
<p>Maybe oceans will rise and wash it away.</p>
<p>Or maybe mushrooms will grow.</p>

  <p><h3><b> <i>Weaving and Peeling Healing</i> </b></h3></p>
<p> I think about resource extraction as a long-haul,
<br> an expanding and growing economy,
<br> but something that will wind down.
<br>I want to be part of that winding.
<br>
<br>Winding is perhaps a way then to counter expropriation
<br>Winding, twisting and weaving are feats we must become comfortable with.
<br>As extractive economies are unwound
<br>the next step is reweaving new slower economies
<br>
<br>I can remember about a year ago a shift
<br>I stopped viewing cattails as an invasive species
<br>I began seeing them as my relations, textiles, fire-starters and food
<br>I wove my first basket but,
<br>
<br>my mother told me I shouldn’t have to sew the seams to keep it from falling apart,
<br>and that basket is fragile, it dried brittle and fry.
<br>The next time I learned new techniques of weaving
<br>I made my first true mat a few days later,
<br>more time but less sewing
<br>a strong vessel and a strong ecology exists around the <span class="sticky"><a href="/Reflections-on-Slowness/Multi-species-care.htm">slow</a></span>.
<br>Winding and weaving are negative feedback loops
<br>
  <br>and the extractive economy always wants new <span class="sticky">growth</span>, and a higher GDP.
<br>Positive positive positive
<br>Hours, years and minutes are commodities to consume
<br>When I met muskwig ‘birch trees’ for the first real time I was 19
<br>I learned to introduce myself
<br>it told me I must peel away nodular cycles of colonial time
<br>it showed me how you decorticate
<br>and that regrowth must take upwards of 20 years.
<br>Maybe part of this is a realization that,
<br>All solutions to this will take longer then my lifetime to grow
<br>and what is harvested now should last until then.
<br>
<br>In making these weavings and peelings
<br>I am thinking about recirculation and flow
<br>flux and current, and circles,
<br>dressing and redressing.
<br>I guess this is the spirit of a gift in the first place,
<br>and these cycles are gifts from my relations.
<br>
<br>these gifts contrast so harshly with wendigo foot prints offered otherwise
<br>It’s like driving past a chainsaw cutting down second or third growth trees
<br>I think about the trace smells of glysophate that cling in the air and to grandmother pine
<br>Where on the ground will its big trunk fall and how long before it’s processed into boards.
<br>Do they even care?
<br>
<br>I get dizzy thinking of the crazed pace of the now
<br>I feel comfort in knowing my migitjo lives in the big pine tree behind my mothers family home.
<br>My bones ache for that tree somedays and so I know why I am here.
<br>To witness the truth of others, and to weave my way to reciprocity and healing.
<br>
<br>Grief and loss will be part of this master basket,
<br>But in the way of changing forms,
<br>and two spirits,
<br>I can be an uncle, and an auntie
<br>
<br>I will stretch my arms and hold my relations
<br>Their fur is soft and black,
<br>I feel the love of bark ridges against my finger pads,
<br>sometimes if I press my ear to a white birch I swear I can hear it
<br>the sound of the wind winding down,
<br>and this is when you’ll see the cattail seeds leap into the wind,
<br>for 21 years, for three cycles of seven I have listened.
<br>
<br>with the ears of my mother Wendy Alexander,
<br>and my grandmother Regina Barnaby,
<brr>and her mother Florine Barnaby
<br>and her mother’s mother Bridget Barnaby,
<br>and when I listen close enough I can hear the voice belonging to Mary Sam of Big Cove.
<br>I will continue for seven generations more.

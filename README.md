# Slow Living Cookbook

Slow Living Cookbook, written by Evelyn Austin and Meech Boakye, is a collection of notes from material research and reflections on making, working, 
and healing slowly amidst crisis and ongoing petrochemical extraction. Asynchronously written thoughts, tangential comments, and recipes interrupt and 
weave together. In their assemblage, borrowing from Anna Tsing, they become performances of livability. The text is published as a website, and will be 
archived through collected sound and images after its exhibition at Xpace Cultural Centre from March 15th to April 23rd.

<h3> Gelatin Molds </h3>
</div>
<p>The mold holds detail well and can be reheated and reused to cast new objects.</p>
<p>Ingredients</>
<ul>
<li>60 mL water</li>
<li>72 mL glycerin</li>
<li>12g or 19 mL gelatin powder</li>
</ul>

<p>Pour water into a glass or metal container to be heated. Add the gelatin to the water, and stir until well combined. Add the glycerin to the mixture and combine. Place the contents on low heat. Do not boil. Stir until the gelatin is dissolved and the glycerin is thoroughly integrated. Remove from heat. </p>
<p> Place the object you would like to make a mold of in a container, and pour the liquid around it until it is submerged. Let cool until firm.</p>
<p>Once youâ€™ve cast your object, you can heat the mold again at low heat until it is liquid again, remove from heat and repeat the process. </p>
